        <!-- 
            Found information on the length limit on email addresses:

                "
                    That limit is a maximum of 64 characters (octets) in the “local part” (before the “@”)
                    and a maximum of 255 characters (octets) in the domain part (after the “@”) for a
                    total length of 320 characters. However, there is a restriction in RFC 2821 on the
                    length of an address in MAIL and RCPT commands of 254 characters. Since addresses
                    that do not fit in those fields are not normally useful, the upper limit on address
                    lengths should normally be considered to be 254.
